write a Webwidgets application and how to use most widgets.

A typical Webwidgets application consists of three things: A user
interface definition (L{UI<Webwidgets.Demo.WidgetParade.UI>}),
callbacks (L{UICallbacks<Webwidgets.Demo.WidgetParade.UICallbacks>})
and a webware context
(L{Webware<Webwidgets.Demo.WidgetParade.Webware>}) integrating it with
webware."""
