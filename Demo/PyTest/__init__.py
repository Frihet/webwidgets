PyTest is a demo application that introduce you to how to
write a Webwidgets application using only python code, no Wwml.

You would not usually write an application this way, for a typical
application look at L{Webwidgets.Demo.WidgetParade}. However, in
certain circumstances it makes sense to write widgets in pure Python.
In addition reading this code will give you a better understanding of
how things really work "under the hood".
