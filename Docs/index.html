  <h1><a name="installation" />Installation</h1>
  <p class="intro">This part helps you install Webwidgets and test that
  it works correctly</p>

  <p>Webwidgets depends on the Python library <a
  href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/">Webware</a>, and the first
  step of the installation is to install <a
  href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/">Webware</a>. Although
  installing Webware is more than half of the work of setting up
  Webwidgets, guiding you through that installation process is out of
  the scope of this documentation.</p>

  <p>For the rest of this guide, we will assume that you have
  installed <a href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/">Webware</a> and
  that you have prepared a <a
  href="http://www.webwareforpython.org/">Webware</a> working
  directory at <tt>/var/www/WebWare</tt>, accessible using Apache
  and mod_webkit at <tt>http://example.com/WKMod</tt>.</p>

  <p>Python modules must be installed in a directory in the python
  path. By default, only the directory
  <tt>/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages</tt> is in the
  python path. Additional directories can be added using the
  <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> environment variable. The second step is thus to
  unpack <tt>Webwidgets.$VERSION.tgz</tt> under
  <tt>/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages</tt>, or anywhere
  else in the python path.</p>

  <p>There are several Webwidgets examples available in
  the Tests subdirectory of the Webwidgets directory. To use these
  without modification, the whole Webwidgets directory must be made
  available as a Webware context. To install this directory as a
  context, add the following line to the file
  <tt>/var/www/WebWare/Configs/Application.config</tt>:</p> 

  <blockquote><pre>
Contexts['Webwidgets'] = '/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages/Webwidgets'
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>After the context has been installed, restart the app server,
  e.g. <tt>/etc/init.d/webkit restart</tt>, and navigate to
  <tt>http://example.com/WKMod/Webwidgets/Tests/WwmlTest1</tt>.</p>

  <!-- ################################################################ -->








  <h1><a name="introduction" />Introduction to Webwidgets</h1>
  <p class="intro">This part will guide you through creating your
  first Webwidgets application. It assumes you have already
  successfully installed Webware and Webwidgets and tested that it
  works as expected.</p>

  <p>A Webwidgets application is in itself a Webware page and each
  Webware page must reside in some Webware context. So the first step
  of creating a Webwidgets application would be to create a Webware
  context: First create the directory
  <tt>/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/HelloWeb</tt>, then add the
  following line to the end of the file
  <tt>/var/www/WebWare/Configs/Application.config</tt>:</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
Contexts['HelloWeb'] = '/usr/lib/python$#PYTHONVERSION/site-packages/HelloWeb'
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>Next, we need to add a Webware page, a user interface
  definition and a callbacks file to the context directory. When
  done, the directory will look thus:</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages/HelloWeb
/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages/HelloWeb/__init__.py
/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages/HelloWeb/index.py #This is the webware page
/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages/HelloWeb/UI
/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages/HelloWeb/UI/__init__.wwml
/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages/HelloWeb/Callbacks
/usr/lib/python$#PYTONVERSION/site-packages/HelloWeb/Callbacks/__init__.py
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>The Webware index page index.py is the main entry point of the
  application which loads the user interface when a new session is
  opened by a user. Do note that Webware requires the Program subclass
  to be named the same as the file (index)</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
#! /bin/env python
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
# vim: set fileencoding=UTF-8 :

import Webwidgets
import HelloWeb.UI

class index(Webwidgets.Program):
    class Session(Webwidgets.Program.Session):
	def newWindow(self, winId):
	    return HelloWeb.UI.MyWindow(self, winId)
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>The user interface definition is the module named UI above and is
  expected to contain a top-level Window subclass called
  MyWindow.</p> 

  <p>It is possible to write the user interface definition in pure
  Python which allows for greate flexibility, but is also quite
  verbose and requires lots and lots of boilerplate code, so the code
  presented here uses the <a href="#wwml">Wwml</a> language to define
  the user interface. This is a simple XML-based language for defining
  the UI layout (but not the actual look - that's the job of <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS</a>!).</p>

  <p>Not only does Wwml simplify the work to create widgets, it also
  helps separating the layout from the application code, which is
  stored in a separate python module file. In this example, that's the
  HelloWeb.Callbacks module.</p>

  <p>First <tt>UI/__init__.wwml</tt>:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;w:wwml
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
 xmlns:w="http://freecode.no/xml/namespaces/wwml-1.0"
 xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
 bind="HelloWeb.Callbacks"
 &gt;
 &lt;w:HtmlWindow
  id="MyWindow"
  title="Redback Webwidgets demo application"&gt;

  &lt;w:StyleLink id="head" style="../../Widgets.css" /&gt;

  &lt;w:Html id="body"&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;Please enter some random string below and press "go"&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;w:Html id="res" html="" /&gt;
    &lt;w:StringInput id="str" /&gt;
    &lt;w:Button id="go" title="go" /&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/w:Html&gt;
 &lt;/w:HtmlWindow&gt;
&lt;/w:wwml&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>Next, the <tt>Callbacks/__init__.py</tt>:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
# vim: set fileencoding=UTF-8 :

class MyWindow(object):
    class body(object):
	class go(object):
	    def clicked(self, path):
		self.parent['res'].html = self.parent['str'].value
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>Hey, that was a load of XML in that Wwml-file. Actually, quite
  a lot of it was just boilerplate that needs to be there for it to be
  correct XML and thus Wwml. We'll go though the code line-by line
  now:</p>

   <blockquote><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;w:wwml
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
 xmlns:w="http://freecode.no/xml/namespaces/wwml-1.0"
 xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
   </pre></blockquote>

   <p>Ok, so that's the boilerplate. This is setting up namespaces for
   Wwml tags and HTML tags, so that they can be freely mixed.</p>

   <blockquote><pre>
 bind="HelloWeb.Callbacks"
 &gt;
   </pre></blockquote>

   <p>This <a href="#wwml_callback-binding">binds</a> the
   python module HelloWeb.Callbacks to the widgets in the interface
   definition, so that the callback function (clicked) defined in
   there will be called when the button in the UI is clicked.</p>

   <blockquote><pre>
 &lt;w:HtmlWindow
  id="MyWindow"
  title="Redback Webwidgets demo application"&gt;
   </pre></blockquote>

   <p>This is what creates our main window widget. The tag name is the
   name of an existing widget, either defined in some other Wwml-file
   in the aplication, or one of the predefined ones from the
   Webwidgets package. The id tag is required, and gives the name of
   the widget that gets created. More information on the tag syntax
   can be found at <a href="#wwml_basic-tag-structure">Basic tag
   structure</a>.</p>

   <blockquote><pre>
  &lt;w:StyleLink id="head" style="../../Widgets.css" /&gt;
   </pre></blockquote>

   <p>This just adds a stylesheet to the head section of the HTML
   document.</p>

   <blockquote><pre>
  &lt;w:Html id="body"&gt;
   </pre></blockquote>

   <p>Here goes the bulk of the document...</p>

   <blockquote><pre>
   &lt;div&gt;Please enter some random string below and press "go"&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;w:Html id="res" html="" /&gt;
    &lt;w:StringInput id="str" /&gt;
    &lt;w:Button id="go" title="go" /&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/w:Html&gt;
 &lt;/w:HtmlWindow&gt;
&lt;/w:wwml&gt;
   </pre></blockquote>
  
  <p>Html code can <a href="#wwml_html-format-strings">freely be
  mixed</a> in with the Wwml inside a w:Html tag. 
  </p>
 
  <p>The callbacks file defines what actually happens when the user
  does something, e.g. clicks on the "go" button. When this happen, a
  callback function is called in this file. This callback can modify
  the user interface "live" - there is no explicit session handling as
  in e.g. PHP or JavaBeans, but it works much the same as <a
  href="http://gtk.org/">Gtk</a> - the UI stays the same until
  explicitly modified, and changes are seen by the user more or less
  directly (as soon as the webpage finishes loading :).</p>


  <blockquote><pre>
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
# vim: set fileencoding=UTF-8 :

class MyWindow(object):
    class body(object):
	class go(object):
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>The layout of the classes defined inside each other in the
  callbacks file exactly mirrors the widget tags in the Wwml file.
  Compare the above to the following exerpt:</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
 &lt;w:HtmlWindow id="MyWindow"&gt;
  &lt;w:Html id="body"&gt;
    &lt;w:Button id="go" title="go" /&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>

  <blockquote><pre>
	    def clicked(self, path):
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>There are several callbacks that can be defined, and the
  available callbacks varies from widget to widget. Every callback
  takes a different set of parameters, but they all share the first
  parameter - <tt>path</tt>, which is the path through the widget tree
  to the widget who's callback is called.</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
		self.parent['res'].html = self.parent['str'].value
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>This sets the HTML code of the <tt>res</tt> child widget of the
  parent widget of the <tt>Button</tt> widget to the string the user
  has entered in the <tt>str</tt> child input widget of the parent
  widget.</p>

  <p>So, if you have managed to read this far, and have a working
  first application and it's time to read up on what widgets there are in
  the <a href="ReferenceManual">reference manual</a> and start
  breaking your first app :P</p>

  <h1><a name="overview" />Architecture overview</h1>
  <h2><a name="overview-design" />Design</h2>

  <p class="intro">This document explains the overall architecture and
  design choices of Webwidgets. It answers both the how:s and the
  why:s.</p>

  <h3><a name="overview_design_user-interfaces-as-widget-trees" />User interfaces as widget trees</h3>
  <p>In Webwidgets everything you see is a widget. Even an
  application is a widget. Each such widget might in its turn
  consist of several other widgets, either by incorporating them as
  child widgets or by subclassing them.</p>

  <p class="rationale">The aim of this library is to encourage and
  ease code re-use - user interface functionality can easily be
  packaged and reused throughout a set of applications.</p>


  
  <h3><a name="overview_design_statefull-widgets" />Statefull widgets</h3>
  <p>Each widget is implemented as a Python class. A web user session
  then consists of one or more instance of such classes.</p>

  <p>As these instances are part of the session, they survive between
  page-loads, and member variables of the widget, such as the one
  holding the value for a string input box or the label string for a
  button, stay the same until actively changed by the user (for input
  widgets) or by the application code.</p>

  <p class="rationale">This removes the burden of re-creating the user
  interface at each page-load, re-reading values from the database at
  each page-load, and manually managing session content.</p>


  <h3><a name="overview_design_notifications" />Notifications</h3>
  <p>As soon as an attribute of a widget is changed, either by user
  input or by some code, a notification is sent to the widget. This
  notification is named as the attribute, with <tt>Changed</tt>
  appended, e.g. <tt>valueChanged</tt> for the <tt>value</tt>
  attribute, and raised with the new value as sole parameter.</p>

  <p>A notification is implemented as a call to a method on the widget
  with a special first parameter <tt>path</tt> that holds the path to
  the widget. Unless that method breaks out by raising a
  <tt>StopIteration</tt> exception, the notification is propagated to
  the parent widget up to the top-level <tt>Window</tt>. All the way
  through this propagation, the <tt>path</tt> parameter stays the
  same, pointing to the originally notified widget.</p>

  <p class="rationale">The propagation makes it possible to implement
  a complicated widget with many fields and just one single function
  to handle all of the state changes.</p>


  <h3><a name="overview_design_input-handling" />Input handling</h3>
  <p>Input handling is done using two special methods,
  <tt>fieldInput</tt> and <tt>fieldOutput</tt>. The former method is
  called with a list of field values, and can update any attributes on
  the widget as it sees fit. This in turn raises notifications as
  usual. The latter method is used to query the widget for its current
  state and should return a list of the same format. This is used to
  inhibit calls to fieldInput when the user hasn't actually changed
  anything.</p>


  <h3><a name="overview_design_url-argument-handling" />URL argument handling</h3>
  <p>URL arguments (<tt>GET</tt> parameters) are grafted onto the
  Webwidgets framework which is based on a global HTML form and
  <tt>POST</tt> requests. Their main purpose is to allow the user to
  bookmark a page, and as an alternative way of user input and
  output.</p> 

  <p>URL arguments always corresponds to widget attribute values. If
  not, the widget attributes are updated (and notifications sent as
  usual).</p>

  <p>However, all widget attributes need not be present in the
  URL, specifically attributes of hidden widgets are never present in
  the URL. If a previously hidden widget is made visible and has
  attributes that are supposed to be in the URL, the browser is sent a
  HTTP redirect to a new URL containing those new values.</p>

  <p class="rationale">This provides the functionality the user
  expects while requiring the least amount of effort from the
  application programmer.</p>

  <h3><a name="overview_design_output-options" />Output options</h3>
  <p>FIXME</p>

  <h3><a name="overview_design_windows" />Windows</h3>
  <p>A Webwidgets application can provide the user with several
  separate pages or windows each with its own widget tree and
  URL. These windows are created by the application after the user has
  navigated to the corresponding URL and must be destroyed by the
  application code manually (ultimately, they are destroyed as the
  session is destroyed when it times out).</p>

  <p class="rationale">It is sometimes desirable to have separate
  pop-up-windows or frames with their own state. This functionality
  provides that.</p>


  <h2><a name="overview_implementation" />Implementation details</h2>

  <h3>Instantiation and initialization</h3>
  <p>When a session is created a <tt>Window</tt> widget is
  instantiated and with it any number of child widgets. This child
  widget instantiation can be done either automatically or manually
  from the initialization method of the parent widget.</p>

  <p>If the child widget does not need any special parameters for its
  initialization method, it can be instantiated automatically and
  nothing special is required except for the child widget class to be
  a member of the parent widget class.</p>

  <p>If the child widget class is a class member of the parent
  widget class while it is not desired for it to be instantiated
  automatically, it has to set a special class member
  variable. Whenever manual instantiation is used for child widgets
  they should be initialized in the parents initialization
  function. The parents initialization function should also give those
  children as parameters to its superclass' initialization
  function.</p>

  <p class="rationale">It is practical to encapsulate child widget
  classes within the parent widget class as this makes the widget
  more portable and parts of it more overrideable. The automatic
  instantiation solves the problem nine times out of ten in
  practice.</p>

  <h3><a name="overview_implementation_output" />Output</h3>
  <p>Output to the web browser can come from one of two sources - a
  widget class or a widget instance depending on the presence of
  <tt>_widget</tt> or <tt>_widgetClass</tt> among the output
  parameters. In the former case, <tt>classOutput(outputOptions)</tt>
  is called on the class, and in the latter
  <tt>output(outputOptions)</tt> is called on the instance.</p>

  <p>The default case is that output comes from the top level widget,
  that is from the window instance. The <tt>output(outputOptions)</tt>
  method of the window instance then constructs the output by calling
  <tt>draw(outputOptions)</tt>, which recurses to
  <tt>draw(outputOptions)</tt> on its child widgets whom in their turn
  may call this function on their children.</p>

  <h4><a name="overview_implementation_output_html" />In-page HTML output</h4>
  <p>The <tt>draw</tt> method is called on a widget to draw the HTML
  of that widget to be incorporated in the output of draw of its
  parent widget. This method can also optionally register input fields
  and URL arguments.</p>

  <p>The <tt>Composite</tt> widget is the base class for all widgets
  that have children and provides methods for recursing over the
  <tt>draw</tt> methods of its children including handling visibility
  of children.</p>

  <h4><a name="overview_implementation_output_raw-data-output" />Raw data output</h4>

  <p>For a widget to include raw data, e.g. an image, CSS file that is
  to be referenced by a link in the HTML, it needs to provide this
  data using one of the <tt>output()</tt> and <tt>classOutput()</tt>
  methods. The widget can construct the URL using the
  <tt>calculateUrl()</tt> method.</p> 

  <!-- ################################################################ -->







  <h1><a name="wwml" />The Wwml user interface markup language</h1>
  <p class="intro">Wwml provides an alternative and much shorter
  syntax for defining widget classes than to define them using pure
  Python. It does however not add any extra functionality. That is,
  every Wwml construct can be mapped into an equivalent Python
  construct, and is indeed compiled to one when the Wwml file is
  loaded.</p> 


  <h2><a name="wwml_the-module-system" />The module system</h2>
  <p>Wwml integrates with Python and its module system in a way that
  makes Wwml files appear as normal Python modules to a Python
  program. Those modules can be imported and used in the same way as
  ordinary Python modules as long as the Webwidgets module has been
  loaded prior to the attempt to load a Wwml module.</p>

  <p>Wwml also imports Python modules (or Wwml files) along with
  widget definitions for widgets that are used in a Wwml file. When
  referring to widgets Wwml uses Python module paths (e.g.
  <tt>Module.SubModule.SomeClass.SomeClassWithinTheFirstClass</tt>).</p>

  <h2><a name="wwml_xml-syntax" />XML syntax</h2>
  <p>Wwml is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> application,
  and uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">XML
  namespaces</a> to separate embedded HTMl code from Wwml code. Wwml
  tags live in the namespace
  <tt>http://freecode.no/xml/namespaces/wwml-1.0</tt>. The outermost
  tag of a Wwml document is always the <tt>wwml</tt> tag which serves
  the purpose of containing namespace declarationsm the callback
  bindings and declaring a search path for widgets.</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;w:wwml
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
 xmlns:w="http://freecode.no/xml/namespaces/wwml-1.0"
 xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"
 &gt;
  </pre></blockquote>

  <h2><a name="wwml_basic-tag-structure" />Basic tag structure</h2>
  <p>Each tag except for the top-level <tt>wwml</tt> tag defines a
  widget class. It consists of a tag name, an id attribute, any number
  of attributes, any number of child widgets and an implicit HTML
  format string (if the tag has children).</p>

  <p>The tag name is the name (or module path) of some existing widget
  to subclass and the id attribute defines the name of the new
  class.</p>

  <p>Attributes and children are interchangable and defines class
  variables for the new class. These can hold either child widgets or
  Python values (e.g. strings, integers, lists, dictionaries...).</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
&lt;w:MyModule.MyWidget id="MyFirstWidget" foo="xyzzy"&gt;
 &lt;w:OtherModule.SubMod.OtherWidget id="bar" /&gt;
&lt;/w:MyModule.MyWidget&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>
  
  <p>This compiles (roughly) into:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
import MyModule, OtherModule.SubMod

class MyFirstWidget(MyModule.MyWidget):
    foo="xyzzy"
    class bar(OtherModule.SubMod.OtherWidget):
        pass
  </pre></blockquote>

  <h2><a name="wwml_special-tags-and-attribute-types" />Special tags and attribute types</h2>
  <p>Wwml allows for attributes to hold values of different types
  (e.g. strings, integers, booleans...). By default an attribute value is
  considered a string. To define an attribute value of a different
  type the attribute value must be prefixed with a <tt>":type:"</tt>,
  (e.g. <tt>":string:My string value here"</tt>, <tt>":integer:4711"</tt>,
  <tt>":time:2007-07-31 17:22:05"</tt>).</p>

  <p>These same types are also available as tags to make attributes
  and children more interchangable.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
&lt;w:MyModule.MyWidget id="MyFirstWidget" foo=":integer:4711"&gt;
 &lt;w:integer id="bar"&gt;4712&lt;/w:integer&gt;
&lt;/w:MyModule.MyWidget&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>


  <h2><a name="wwml_html-format-strings" />HTML format strings</h2>
  <p>Wwml is intended to assist in writing complicated user interfaces
  that mixes widgets and static HTML content. To help with this, Wwml
  provides widgets with a special attribute called <tt>html</tt> that
  holds a Python format string corresponding to the content inside the
  Wwml tag for the widget. All non-wwml content (e.g. HTML tags and
  text) is copied as-is to this attribute while Wwml tags are
  replaced by <tt>%(id)s</tt>, where id is the value of the
  <tt>id</tt> attribute of the child tag.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
&lt;w:Html id="MySearchBox"&gt;
 &lt;div class="SearchBox"&gt;
  &lt;w:StringInput id="query" value="*.*" /&gt;
  &lt;img src="http://example.org/pic.png" /&gt;
  &lt;w:Button id="search" title="Search" /&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/w:Html&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>
  
  <p>This compiles (roughly) into:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
import MyModule, OtherModule.SubMod

class MySearchBox(Html):
    html = """

  <p>This is the foundation for using the <tt>Html</tt> widget, which
  uses this format string to merge the rendering of its child widgets.
  This widget is useful for implementing fancy layouts, extra CSS
  hooks and intermingle widgets with static text (e.g. labels,
  descriptions, help-texts etc).</p>


  <h2><a name="wwml_callback-binding" />Callback binding</h2>
  <p>A user interface is nothing without interactivity, in
  Webwidgets this is provided by callback functions. Callback
  functions can not be declared within Wwml as Wwml is not a
  programming language but a purely declarative UI definition
  language. Instead the Wwml widget definition has to "bind" to some
  Python class implementing the callbacks.</p>

  <p>A callback class is bound to a widget using the the <tt>bind</tt>
  attribute which specifies a class with callback methods.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
&lt;w:MyModule.MyWidget id="MyFirstWidget" foo="xyzzy" bind="MyCallBacks.MyCallbackClass" /&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>
  
  <p>This compiles into:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
import MyModule, MyCallBacks

class MyFirstWidget(MyCallBacks.MyCallbackClass, MyModule.MyWidget):
    foo="xyzzy"
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p>To reduce code overhead, callback binding recurses through
  widgets so that child widgets are bound to member classes:</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
&lt;w:Html id="MyFirstWidget" bind="MyCallBacks.MyCallbackClass"&gt;
 &lt;w:Html id="SomeWidget"&gt;
  &lt;w:Button id="SomeButton" title="Push me" /&gt;
 &lt;/w:Html&gt;
&lt;/w:Html&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>
  
  <p>This compiles into:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
import MyModule, MyCallBacks

class MyFirstWidget(MyCallBacks.MyCallbackClass, html):
    class SomeWidget(MyCallBacks.MyCallbackClass.SomeWidget, Html):
        class MyFirstWidget(MyCallBacks.MyCallbackClass.SomeWidget.SomeButton, Button):
            title = "Push me"
  </pre></blockquote>


  <h2><a name="wwml_search-paths-for-widgets" />Search paths for widgets</h2>
  <p>As already stated tag names are module paths to existing widget
  classes. But these paths need not be complete - they are looked up
  along a search path of modules.</p>

  <p>Consider a search path consisting of <tt>MyProg.UI</tt>,
  <tt>MyLib.Widgets</tt> and <tt>Webwidgets</tt>. The tag
  <tt>&lt;w:Foo.SomeWidget /&gt;</tt> then results in a lookup for</p>
  <ul>
   <li><tt>MyProg.UI.Foo.SomeWidget</tt></li>
   <li><tt>MyLib.Widgets.Foo.SomeWidget</tt></li>
   <li><tt>Webwidgets.Foo.SomeWidget</tt></li>
  </ul>
  <p>and the first existing class in that list will be used.</p>

  <p>Search paths can be overridden for any widget and its children by
  specifying the <tt>using</tt> attribute. The contents of this
  attribute is a space separated list of module paths which is
  prepended to the search path used to lookup the widget and all its
  children.</p>

  <blockquote><pre>
&lt;w:Html id="MyFirstWidget" using="Webwidgets" &gt;
 &lt;w:Html id="SomeWidget" using="MyProg.UI MyLib.Widgets"&gt;
  &lt;w:Button id="SomeButton" title="Push me" /&gt;
 &lt;/w:Html&gt;
&lt;/w:Html&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>

  <h1><a name="license" />GNU Free Documentation License</h1>
<p>

Version 1.2, November 2002
</p>

<pre>
Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

<h3>0. PREAMBLE</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>

<p>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

</p>

<p>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>

<h3>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</h3>
<p>
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>

<p>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>

<p>

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>

<p>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>

<p>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>

<p>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</p>

<p>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

</p>

<p>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>

<p>
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
</p>

<p>
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>

<h3>2. VERBATIM COPYING</h3>
<p>

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>

<p>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>

<h3>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h3>
<p>
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>

<p>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>

<p>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>

<p>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>

<h3>4. MODIFICATIONS</h3>
<p>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A.</strong> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
  from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
  (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
  of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
  if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</li>

  <li><strong>B.</strong> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
  responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
  Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
  Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
  unless they release you from this requirement.</li>
  <li><strong>C.</strong> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
  Modified Version, as the publisher.</li>
  <li><strong>D.</strong> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</li>
  <li><strong>E.</strong> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
  adjacent to the other copyright notices.</li>

  <li><strong>F.</strong> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
  giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
  terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</li>
  <li><strong>G.</strong> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
  and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</li>
  <li><strong>H.</strong> Include an unaltered copy of this License.</li>
  <li><strong>I.</strong> Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
  to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
  publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
  there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
  stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
  given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
  Version as stated in the previous sentence.</li>

  <li><strong>J.</strong> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
  public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
  the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
  it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
  You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
  least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
  publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</li>
  <li><strong>K.</strong> For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
  Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
  the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
  and/or dedications given therein.</li>
  <li><strong>L.</strong> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
  unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
  or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</li>
  <li><strong>M.</strong> Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
  may not be included in the Modified Version.</li>

  <li><strong>N.</strong> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
  or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</li>
  <li><strong>O.</strong> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>

</ul>

<p>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>

<p>
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>

<p>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>

<p>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>

<h3>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h3>
<p>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>

<p>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>

<p>
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements."
</p>

<h3>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</h3>

<p>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>

<p>

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>


<h3>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</h3>
<p>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>

<p>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>

<h3>8. TRANSLATION</h3>
<p>

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>

<p>
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>

<h3>9. TERMINATION</h3>
<p>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
</p>

<h3>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</h3>
<p>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

</p>

<p>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
</p>

<h3>How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>

<pre>
      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
	 Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

</pre>

<p>
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:
</p>

<pre>
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
</pre>

<p>
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>

<p>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
